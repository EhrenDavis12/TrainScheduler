### Instructions

* Make sure that your app suits this basic spec:
  
  * When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
    
    * Train Name
    
    * Destination 
    
    * First Train Time -- in military time
    
    * Frequency -- in minutes
  
  * Code this app to calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.
  
  * Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.
  
  * Styling and theme are completely up to you. Get Creative!

### Bonus (Extra Challenge)

* Try adding `update` and `remove` buttons for each train. Let the user edit the row's elements-- allow them to change a train's Name, Destination and Arrival Time (and then, by relation, minutes to arrival).
